    "The Broaden and Build Theory (BBT) (Fredrickson, 2001) states that certain positive emotions (like joy, interest, pride and happines) broaden our mind, while negative emotions (sadness, anger, being afraid) narrow our thoughts. When we are happy our thoughts leap from topic to topic. When we are sad, our thoughts are more narrowly clustered and we tend to be unable to let go of our negative thoughts. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the BBT, this mechanism evolved to focus attention, cognition and actions on immediate threats. Positive emotions support exploration and experimentation which serve to enhance survival skills (Fredrickson, 2013; Fredrickson et al., 2004). Cognitive breadth, denotes in this context, the variety of the content of cognitive processes (Schweighofer, 2018).Postulating that affect impacts cognitive breadth, we might observe an impact on semantic breadth. \n",

    "Several studies have already found characteristic semantic features in the online communication of individuals with depression (Hswen et. al., 2018). However, there are currently no studies on the characteristics of semantic features of individuals with bipolar disorder. "
